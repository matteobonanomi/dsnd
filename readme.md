# DATA SCIENCE NANODEGREE PROGRAMM by Udacity

This repo is made for sharing the material of [Data Science Nanodegree Program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) I was enrolled in.
It's a collection of Jupyter notebook and Python scripts used during this nanodegree. I think this online course is a quite solid introduction to Data Science, both from a mathematical point of view and from a more cross-functional level.
* **First Term** (3 months) covers Machine Learning algorithms, both mathematical formulation and related Python libraries explanation
* **Second Term** (4 months) deals with a series of hot topics for Data Science: Data Engineering, Software Engineering, Experimental Design, Data Visualization and Storytelling. 

I hope you can find useful tips and pieces of code in this repo. The aim is let you understand how powerful Python is when dealing with Data Science projects.
